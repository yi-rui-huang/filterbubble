Based on Michael Crichton's so-so novel, it's a nutty mixture of lost cities, giant hippos, monster monkeys, naff visual effects and corny dialogue. The first thing that scuppers this tosh is the gorilla that can communicate in sign language, and needless to say the film doesn't get any better from that point on. Making all this old rope somewhat worthwhile are Tim Curry, turning in a feverish slice of ham and sporting a bizarre accent that defies identification, and Ernie Hudson, who also seems to know that this is all a load of old rubbish.",

While starting as a light-hearted comedy, the movie gradually shifts into a heart-wrenching drama uncovering family history and the horrors of World War II. With beautiful shots of the Ukrainian countryside and deeply emotional themes, the film beautifully intertwines humor and tragedy."

While the film may attract a cult following, its appeal lies mainly in its gory moments, and not in its story or characters. Overall, it feels more like a generic slasher film rather than a homage to classic horror."

Through complex dialogue and role reversals, the movie critiques celebrity culture, reducing these larger-than-life figures to fragile, insecure humans. Roeg’s direction and Terry Johnson’s witty screenplay unfold with playful execution, melding history with philosophical musings, while the cast effectively portrays characters weighed down by their fame and self-doubt."

The animated characters are cute and funny with no crude humor, and the movie maintains a light-hearted, cartoony atmosphere. While not groundbreaking in its animation, it is pleasant to watch, though adults might find it lacks deeper humor or complex storytelling.",

The characters and funny memorable scenes, like Scrat's antics and the Dodo scene, won the reviewer over. The movie successfully balances sentimentality and cliché, leaving a lasting emotional impact."

The movie, known for its improvised dialogue, explores themes like stasis versus change in human life. Despite some uneven dialogue, the amateur actors deliver authentic performances, and the film is widely recognized as a forerunner of the indie film movement.",

The film centers on racial tensions among a group of black siblings, one of whom becomes entangled in an interracial relationship. Though dated by today's standards, it is an important and realistic look into the beat generation, with an improvisational style that heavily influenced filmmakers like Martin Scorsese."

Fans of cheesy 80’s films and buddy cop movies might enjoy this light-hearted collaboration."

While Noel Coward's acting is criticized as wooden and lacking emotion, David Lean’s technical expertise and visual storytelling elevate the film. It's an interesting debut for Lean, showcasing his editing skills, though it’s more of a propaganda piece than a deep or penetrating narrative."

The film offers a satisfying and thoughtful conclusion, making it a rewarding watch for those seeking both challenge and entertainment."

There was too much predictability to the lines and actions not as if a natural occurrence or conversation. The wig on Rachel Kimsey was obvious. The actresses playing Native American sisters, could have played non-native parts and should have. Wardrobe for the Native Americans could have been better and a little more authentic looking. If I decide to watch it with any friends in the future, I will do so, not with the expectations of watching a good Western, but with the expectations of watching an amateur comedy film production.>\n\nReview Summary: The reviewer found the movie disappointing, criticizing the acting, dialogue, and predictable plot.

            "review1": "Probably one of the funniest so-bad-it's-good movies. The characters take an absurd amount of time realizing what a volcano is, and the rest of the movie involves using implausible methods, like fire trucks, to divert lava through a city. The acting is comically bad, making this an unintentional comedy that leaves viewers in disbelief it was ever made. Worth watching purely for laughs if found cheaply."
